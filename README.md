Hi, I’m @jheru11 <br>
I’m interested in computation, arts, technology, education and culture. 
I’m currently learning python, I'm doing a #100DaysOfCode and I'll try to share my projects in repos here. 
I’m looking to collaborate on diferents proyects, I like robotics, data science, backend with Django, and more...
